# 🎲 Dice Game

Welcome to the Dice Game! This is a simple web-based game where two players roll dice, and the player with the higher number wins. If both players roll the same number, it's a draw. Refresh the page to play again!

## 📝 Description

This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a basic game. The game logic is written in JavaScript, which randomly generates numbers for the dice rolls and updates the page to show the winner.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The page will automatically roll the dice for both players.
3. The player with the higher number wins. If both players roll the same number, it's a draw.
4. Refresh the page to play again.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file for the game.
- `style.css` - The CSS file for styling the game.
- `index.js` - The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
- `images` - A folder containing dice images (dice1.png, dice2.png, etc.).
